Coding Handbook
========

My personal coding style guide and development environment handbook.

>The long-term value of software to an organization is in direct proportion to the quality of the codebase. Over its lifetime, a program will be handled by many pairs of hands and eyes. If a program is able to clearly communicate its structure and characteristics, it is less likely that it will break when modified in the never-too-distant future.

>Code conventions can help in reducing the brittleness of programs.

>All of our JavaScript code is sent directly to the public. It should always be of publication quality.

>Neatness counts.

##Editor

[Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) FTW!

###Packages

Here are the packages I use to make Sublime even more awesome. Note: Install 'Package Control' first, it will make installing any of the others alot easier.

#### Sublime Settings
These are my general user settings for sublime, some are package related.

Menu: `Sublime Text 2 -> Preferences -> Settings - User`

	{
		"theme": "Flatland Dark.sublime-theme",
		"color_scheme": "Packages/Theme - Flatland/Flatland Dark.tmTheme",
		"flatland_square_tabs": true,
		"flatland_sidebar_tree_xsmall": true,
		"ignored_packages": [
			"Vintage"
		],
		"open_files_in_new_window": false
	}

#### JsFormat Settings
This will auto run the JsFormat on any files detected as JavaScript or JSON when saved.

Menu: `Sublime Text 2 -> Preferences -> Package Settings -> JsFormat -> Settings - User`

	{
		"format_on_save": true
	}

#### JSHint Gutter Settings

Menu: `Sublime Text 2 -> Preferences -> Package Settings -> JSHint Gutter -> Set Linting Preferences`

	{
		"node": true,
		"esnext": true,
		"globals": {},
		"smarttabs": true,
		"trailing": true,
		"undef": true,
		"unused": true,
		"devel": true,
		"browser": true,
		"multistr": true
	}

#### Trailing Spaces Settings
This will auto cleanup any trailing spaces in a document when saved.

Menu: `Sublime Text 2 -> Preferences -> Package Settings -> Trailing Spaces -> Settings - User`

	{
		"trailing_spaces_highlight_color": "comment",
		"trailing_spaces_modified_lines_only": false,
		"trailing_spaces_include_current_line": false,
		"trailing_spaces_trim_on_save": true
	}


#### Terminal
I use iTerm 2 for my terminal, to open iTerm by default using the Terminal plugin, change the following setting:

Menu: `Sublime Text 2 -> Preferences -> Package Settings -> Terminal -> Settings - User`

	{
		"terminal": "iTerm.sh"
	}


#### Editor Config
Each project should be setup with a `.editorconfig` file in the root. This will force sublime to respect your indention settings.

Sample `.editorconfig` file:

	; top-most EditorConfig file
	root = true

	[**]
	indent_style = space
	indent_size = 4
	end_of_line = lf
	charset = utf-8
	trim_trailing_whitespace = true

### Custom Key Bindings

I override the default paste behavior with the sublime action `paste_and_indent` which will try to paste at the correct indention level as the surronding code.

Menu: `Sublime Text 2 -> Preferences -> Key Bindings - User`

	[{
		"keys": ["super+v"],
		"command": "paste_and_indent"
	}, {
		"keys": ["super+shift+v"],
		"command": "paste"
	}]

##JavaScript

I spend most of my day writing JavaScript. This is how I prefer to do it.

### Code Style

I follow the general practices of the following [style guide](http://javascript.crockford.com/code.html) published by Douglas Crockford.

### General Rules

* Semicolons everywhere.
* Indentation should use 4 spaces. Tabs should never be used.
* Lines should have soft breaks at 80 characters for readability.
* Declare all vars at the begining of scope.
* Brackets go on the same line as function/if/switch statement.
* All conditionals use brackets regards of it they are required.
* Use === and !== in all conditionals.
* Don't use eval unless you fill out a TPS report.
